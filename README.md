This repository contains the source code for the book **[Business Data Science: A guide for data-driven decisions](https://book.martinez.fyi)**. The book provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and applications of business data science, with a focus on making sound, data-driven decisions through causal inference.

## 📖 About the Book

In the modern business landscape, data isn't just an asset – it's the raw material from which informed decisions are forged. Data, however, does not speak for itself. The extraction of actionable insights requires not only technical prowess, but a sophisticated understanding of causal inference. This is where the business data scientist steps in, acting as the voice of data, translating its complex signals into meaningful narratives that drive strategic decision-making.

Throughout this book, we navigate the core principles of causal inference, learning how to confidently identify cause-and-effect relationships within data. Our exploration emphasizes a "decisions first" philosophy, ensuring data analysis is always laser-focused on informing and optimizing decision-making. Topics include:

- The Potential Outcomes Framework & Causal Inference
- Randomized Controlled Trials (A/B testing, factorial designs)
- Observational methods (Matching, Causal Impact, Synthetic Control)
- Generalized Linear Models & Bayesian thinking
- Stochastic Trees (BART, BCF)
