As the name suggests, RCEs involve quick systematic tests to facilitate learning around programmatic elements. They can be used to diagnose challenges, identify facilitators to implementation and take-up, and test potential solutions. RCEs can be useful at early stages of implementation or program design to help identify operational choices that can maximize chances of a program’s success, as well as during program implementation if a program does not appear to be achieving the desired results. RCE approaches can also be used to test short-term program effectiveness, when taking a program to scale, or when seeking to adapt a successful implementation effort in a different context. This chapter describes the steps involved in implementing RCE and provides several instances of using RCE for program design and improvement.}",

 doi={10.18637/jss.v076.i01},
 abstract={Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) is a recent method that has been documented to perform well on data generating processes with strong confounding of the sort that is plausible in many applications. This paper develops a novel algorithm for fitting the BCF model, which is more efficient than the previous Gibbs sampler. The new algorithm can be used to initialize independent chains of the existing Gibbs sampler leading to better posterior exploration and coverage of the associated interval estimates in simulation studies. The new algorithm is compared to related approaches via simulation studies as well as an empirical analysis.}
